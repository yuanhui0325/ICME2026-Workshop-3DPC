                    <p>Over the past several decades, many researchers have worked toward advancing immersive media technologies, a highly challenging and cutting-edge area of study. However, due to technical constraints and limited computational resources, early prototypes emerged only slowly during the 1980s and 1990s. With recent advances in high-performance computing, high-speed communication, and big data-driven artificial intelligence, immersive media technologies have developed rapidly and are becoming more and more popular in applications such as virtual and augmented reality and immersive 3D telepresence. Currently, immersive media typically includes 3D video, 360-degree video, 3D point clouds, and light fields. Compared with traditional 2D images and videos, these new media forms can significantly improve user experience and have the potential to change daily life.</p>
